# AGforPG
Repository belonging to the Bachelor thesis "Artificial Intelligence in Geometric Theorem Proving"

Use with AlphaGeometry (T. H. Trinh et al. “Solving olympiad geometry without human demonstrations”. In: Nature 625
(2024), 476–482): https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry
and Cinderella: https://www.cinderella.de/tiki-index.php

With solve.sh and examples.txt in the root of AG, solve.sh can be called to start AG with the predefined problems in examples.txt. DD_rules contains modified rule sets which can be used by renaming them to rules.txt and moving them to the root. 

The Cindersella tool can be used by saving a proof in the input.txt file and running the entire Cinderella notebook.

The Konstruktionen folder contains constructions used for the thesis, some of which are visualized with our tool.
